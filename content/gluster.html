                    <p></p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://gluster.org"><b>GlusterFS</b></a> is an Open Source project funded by Red Hat. The project activities are slowed down and the project is not in healthy condition. The GlusterFS project needs support from the community and the companies. (Ref: <a target="_blank" href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhs">Red Hat announced End of Life for their Gluster based product and it is supported till Dec 2024</a>)</p>

                    <p><a href="https://kadalu.tech" target="_blank"><b>Kadalu Technologies</b></a> started at the end of the year 2019. This company was started by a few GlusterFS core team members to create an Opinionated storage solution based on GlusterFS. We developed many new projects to improve the GlusterFS experience and monitoring. Kadalu Kubernetes Storage is the most popular project from Kadalu Technologies that provides storage for the apps running in Kubernetes. Kadalu Storage is an opinionated storage solution based on GlusterFS.</p>

                    <p>We donâ€™t want the GlusterFS project to be abandoned without maintenance. We are a startup company and we will not be able to maintain without the support of the community and the companies who are using GlusterFS.</p>
                    
                    <p><img src="/images/glusterfs_needs_help.png" alt="GlusterFS needs help"/></p>
                    
                    <p>We are proposing to take the following maintenance activities for the next three years if we get the funding support from the community and the companies.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Release management - Continue the existing release cycle and manage the releases. Support the packages for CentOS, Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian.</li>
                        <li>Website management - Migration to Github pages with a simple theme. Review blog posts from the community to publish in gluster.org. Maintain Gluster.org domain renewal and other activities.</li>
                        <li>Monthly community meetings - Promote community participation, publish the minutes to gluster.org. Notify developers/maintainers, if any urgent issues reported by users in these meetings.</li>
                        <li>Incoming Issues Triage - Response to the issues in 2 working days. Forward the issue to the respective developer/maintainer if available. Discuss the issues in the meeting if not addressed for two weeks. </li>

                    <p><b>Target</b>: <span class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold has-background-white-bis px-2 py-1">$ 240K for 3 years</span>.
