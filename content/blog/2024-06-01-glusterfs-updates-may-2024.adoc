== Premium packages

- **Enable GNFS** - GlusterFS native NFS is disabled in upstream published packages. We are testing the GlusterFS packages with gnfs enabled. Both Gnfs and NFS Ganesha will be available for users. Read link:/blog/gnfs-and-nfs-ganesha[this blog post] to know more about Gnfs and NFS Ganesha.
- **Ubuntu packages** - Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 packages are built and testing is in progress.

== Glusterd Plus
- **APIs** - APIs for Peer add, Peer list and delete peer added.

GET    /api/v1/peers          -> List Peers

- **Web Console** - UI changes related to Peers management are now available.
- **Prometheus and JSON metrics integration** - Glusterd Plus can now export the metrics in Prometheus or JSON format. Peers related metrics are available now. All the metrics exported via the Gluster Metrics Exporter project will be available with Glusterd Plus.
